# 🎨 Chromesthesia Chord Engine  
### Visualizing Music Through Chords and Colors

## Project Overview

Inspired by the fascinating phenomenon of **chromesthesia**—where individuals *see* colors when they hear music—this project provides a unique way to experience sound visually.

The **Chromesthesia Chord Engine** analyzes musical audio, detects chord progressions, and translates those chords into dynamic visual representations using colors and shapes. This allows users to literally **see the emotional landscape of music** as it plays.

Developed for a **Data Science class**, this project bridges music composition, audio analysis, and machine learning to create a tool that is both technically innovative and personally expressive.

## How It Works

The system processes audio input and follows these steps:

1. Extracts audio features relevant to harmony and pitch
2. Uses a trained machine learning model to predict chords
3. Maps predicted chords to a custom color and shape palette
4. Animates visuals in real time or generates a synchronized video output

## Key Highlights

### 🎼 Chord Detection
- Uses **chroma-based audio features** to accurately detect chord progressions in music tracks.

### 🌈 Dynamic Visualization
- Translates detected chords into an engaging visual experience using a custom-designed **color and shape mapping**.

### 🧪 Programmatically Generated Dataset
- Trained on **synthetic chord audio samples**, enabling precise control over chord labels and data balance.

## Technical Details

### Dataset
- Programmatically generated **synthetic chord audio**
- Covers a wide range of **major and minor triads**

### Algorithm
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for chord classification
- Operates on **mel-spectrogram features**
- Replaced an initially considered **Random Forest Classifier** for improved accuracy and pattern recognition

### Tools & Libraries
- **Google Colab**
- **Python**
- `librosa` – audio analysis & feature extraction  
- `scikit-learn` – data preprocessing (`LabelEncoder`, `train_test_split`)  
- `tensorflow` – CNN model training  
- `matplotlib` – visualization utilities  
- `soundfile` – audio I/O  
- `moviepy` – video generation  
- `Pillow` – image manipulation  

### Techniques Used
